Consisent spacing is the only issue with your code, variable names look good and so do the comments. Your diagram contains all of the necessary classes and symbols - nice! Your design explains a lot of high level choices but does not explain the types of cohesion/coupling and why you used them. The game works for a single scene, but then it has a hashmap error loading scenes afterward. I think this would benefit from more testing because your implementation was on the right track!
