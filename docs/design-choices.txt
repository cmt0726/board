The biggest change we made was getting rid of any 2D array in exchange for hash maps for the board locations. This was easier to acqure adjacent positions on the board for the player to move to. We also merged the Increase Rank, Act, and Take Role actions into one Player Action class to make it easier to pull what the player would like to do. Changing how the board and role info worked with the hashmaps also gave the Board and Player classes more variables that needed to be accounted for. Having more getters and setters allowed for easy access to data changes required to update what the player can do. The hashmap and Player Action class also made the Move class irrelevant so that was removed.
